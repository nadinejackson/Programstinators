Description:

A text-based game of Mafia where the player is randomly assigned a role of Citizen,
Doctor, Detective, or Mafia, competes against other pre-programmed players, and attempts to survive.
The user begins the game by selecting or being randomly assigned a role. When 
night falls, the Mafia kills off one player. The Doctor can select a player to heal, and if 
healed, the killed player survives the night. Roles of all players are revealed upon death.  
When the night ends and day comes, the killed player’s role is revealed. Evidence 
and hints are left at the scene, but the user gains SP (suspicious points) if they choose to 
snoop. The user can interrogate the players, as well as provide alibis. These 
interrogations and dialogues are shown to the townspeople and the user to determine 
who is guilty. At the end of the day, the townspeople cast their votes. The Detectives’ 
vote are worth more than the Citizens’, and the highest voted player is killed/burned at 
the stake. The players have a SP (suspicious points) stat, based on the cumulative 
number of votes they receive, as well as the value of their chosen alibis. The user can 
factor this into their decision when voting.

Rules:

- User is initially prompted with a Start Menu, where rules and commands are 
displayed. They set their name, the number of players, and their role ( or opt to 
have it randomized ) 
- After selection, a list of all players, their names, SP/votes, day roles, and a short 
quote from them is displayed. This can be called up at any time by typing C, and 
the rules by typing R

- Night 
- If the user has extra abilities, they are prompted to choose which player perform 
those abilities on. 
- Kill: Displays success or failure based on Doctor’s actions 
- Heal: Displays success if Mafia killed the same player, else failure 
- Investigate: Displays the real role of the player

- Day  
- Starts with a short description of the killed player and death scene.  -
User is prompted by a list of actions (Investigate, Eavesdrop, Converse, 
Defend) 
- Converse (x Actions Left): The user can choose who to converse 
with, and 3 questions to select from.   
- Investigate (x Actions Left): Check the death scene for evidence, 
at the risk of gaining SP. 
- Eavesdrop (x Actions Left): Listen to dialogue between two other 
players, at the risk of gaining SP. 
- Defend (n Questions Left) : The player wakes up to 3 
questions/accusations every day. These are not in the same category 
as the above 3 actions, which are limited in number. Defend shows 
the question and 3 possible alibis to choose from.  
- Open notebook : The player has a notebook where they can store 
clues and other information that they have found. They have the 
option to read it, write in it, or erase entries. 
- Once the x actions are used up, the user is prompted to vote on who is 
most likely part of the mafia. After voting, if there is no tie, then the 
person voted most likely is hanged. An updated stats list is displayed, and 
players go home for the night.
